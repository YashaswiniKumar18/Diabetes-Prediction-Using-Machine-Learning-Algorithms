## DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood. 
Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing severe outcomes.
Machine learning offers powerful tools to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals
Thus aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.
## OBJECTIVE
We predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on certain medical and lifestyle factors. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using various algorithms and compare the accuracy rate.
